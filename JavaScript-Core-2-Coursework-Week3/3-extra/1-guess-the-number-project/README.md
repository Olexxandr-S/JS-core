## Advanced Challenges

### Number of Tries

Develop the application further and display the number of tries taken for the user to guess the number.

If the user guesses the random number within the number of tries, print 'It took you ' + TriesTaken + ' tries';

### Let The Player Lose

Lets make our application a little cooler, incorporate a 'tries' functionality, where a user only has certain number of tries to guess the number.

If the user were to exceed the number of tries the print out a message print 'You Lose, the number was ' + randomNumber;
